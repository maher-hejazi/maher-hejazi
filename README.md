# 👋 Hi, I’m Maher Hejazi

I’m a **Software Architect & Engineering Lead** with deep hands-on experience building **large-scale, distributed systems** — primarily in **.NET**, **cloud-native**, and **event-driven architectures**.

I spend most of my time designing and evolving **platforms, frameworks, and internal tooling** that other teams build on, with a strong focus on **reliability, performance, and long-term maintainability**.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

- Design **microservice and modular-monolith architectures** that scale in both traffic *and* team size  
- Build **framework-level abstractions** (message bus, caching, data access, security, jobs, observability)  
- Lead **distributed messaging systems** (RabbitMQ, Kafka, SMPP, outbox/inbox patterns, exactly-once flows)  
- Architect **high-throughput systems** (10k+ msgs/sec, multi-tenant, noisy-neighbor isolation)  
- Define **engineering standards**: Result pattern, Specification pattern, Repository abstractions, domain boundaries  
- Turn business problems into **clear, executable technical roadmaps**

I care less about *trendy tools* and more about **correctness, clarity, and operational reality**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Practical, Not Theoretical)

### Backend & Architecture
- .NET (modern versions), C#, ASP.NET Core, Minimal APIs  
- Distributed systems, DDD-inspired modeling, domain services  
- Messaging: RabbitMQ, Kafka, IBM MQ, SMPP  
- Patterns: Outbox/Inbox, CQRS (when justified), Idempotency, Resilience  

### Data
- PostgreSQL, SQL Server  
- EF Core, Dapper  
- PgBouncer, connection pooling, schema design for scale  

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- Kubernetes (on-prem & cloud-like environments)  
- .NET Aspire (orchestration, service discovery, observability)  
- CI/CD pipelines, container registries, Linux servers  
- Storage systems (Ceph / Rook)

### Observability
- OpenTelemetry (metrics, logs, traces)  
- Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger  
- System-level and business-level metrics

## 🧩 How I Think

- **Abstractions must earn their place**  
- **Framework code should reduce decisions, not hide them**  
- **Operational concerns are first-class design inputs**  
- **If it can’t be observed, it’s not production-ready**  
- **“Simple” beats “clever” — especially at scale**

---

## 🏗 Current Focus

- Building internal **platform frameworks** for multi-team systems  
- Designing **event-driven government & enterprise platforms**  
- Improving **developer experience** through templates, standards, and tooling  
- Mentoring engineers on **architecture, not just syntax**

---

## 🌍 Beyond Code

I work closely with **product, stakeholders, and leadership**, translating business goals into technical systems that actually ship and survive production.

I’m currently building toward running my own **software development house**, starting with large-scale public-sector systems.
